Usage: rewavi <input> <output> [ -r | -x [<mask>] ]
  input  : input AVI1.0( or AviSynth Script)file name.
  output : output WAV file name. '-' means output to stdout
  -r : Write a raw file of samples without the WAV header.
  -x : Write an extended WAV header containing channel mask for
       multi-channel audio.
       If channel mask is not specified, the defaut value will be set.

 'rewavi -h' will display more complicated description.

This utility extracts the first uncompressed PCM audio track
from an AVI1.0 file and saves it to a WAV file. This is not quite
useful for most AVI files since they usually contain some kind
of compressed audio, but it can come handy when it's needed to
save an audio track from AviSynth.

If <input> is a valid AVI1.0 file which contains PCM audio,
the audio track will be written to <output> as a WAV(or RAW) file.
If '-' is passed as <output>, the WAV file will be written
to the standard output.
If <output> is not given, only information will be printed
about the audio track.

On success, the exit code will be 0 and the first line printed
to the standard error will look like the following:
    streamID <n>: <c>channels, <r>Hz, <b>bits, <l>sec.

Where <n> is IDnumber of audio track that comtaining PCM audio, <c> is
the number of audio channels, <r> is the sampling rate, <b> is the number
of bits per sample and <l> is the length of the track in seconds.

If the audio track contains floating-point samples, the next line
printed to the standard error will be:
Audio track contains floating-point samples.

If an error occurs, the exit code will be 1 and some useful error
message will be printed to the standard error.

WAV files larger than 4 GB may be created. However, such WAV files
are non-standard and may not be handled correctly by some players
and encoders. A warning will be printed to the standard error when
such a WAV file is created.

The default channel masks are:
